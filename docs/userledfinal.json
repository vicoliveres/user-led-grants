Authentic Biology will replicate the   successful MBP2 project in four locations in England, involving 300 sixth   formers experiencing real genetics research and 20 teachers as supervisors. School science is often criticised for not reflecting how research takes   place in the laboratory, whilst subject-specific teacher CPD remains a luxury   for most. At Simon Langton Grammar School we have challenged both these views through successfully piloting a programme of student-led research under the   stewardship of teachers, specially trained in the molecular techniques. MBP2   (Myelin Basic Protein Project) comprises some 95 Year 12 and 13 students, who   working in teams, have employed biochemistry and molecular biology research   methods to explore the chemical nature of the structurally fragile protein   MBP, responsible for the development of Multiple Sclerosis in some   individuals. Following our successful pilot, funded through Wellcome Trust   People Awards, we are seeking to expand the potential of MBP2-style projects   to become embedded in the biology experience of sixth form students and the   professional learning of teachers in each of the participating schools,   initially in schools in four regions in England. Our vision is that Authentic   Biology will remodel biology education to make it stimulating for students   whilst also offering valuable CPD enhanced training opportunities for   teachers and providing valuable experience for university thinking and   teaching. Simon Langton will draw on its experience and in-house expertise to   work with schools and university research scientists to lead this novel   approach in the four regions. Expected outcomes include: 1. Inspired and   knowledgeable sixth-form students 2. A cadre of biology teachers well-versed   in current laboratory techniques and confident to apply these to their   teaching 3. Sustained relationships between schools and university   departments 4. Beacons of school research excellence 5. Protocol to introduce   in further schools 6. A series of research symposia 7. A research-led   teaching experience to prepare the next generation of scientists\n\n\n","AmountAwarded":185494,"AwardDate":"2015-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:Simon-Langton-Grammar-School-for-Boys","RecipientOrgName":"Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Society Award","Year":2015,"Theme":"Children and youngs","ThemeFreq":334,"OrgType":"School","OrgTypeFreq":36,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-phf-30692","Title":"Core funding for expansion of Xplode's youth-led model","Description":"Xplode is a youth-led charity, based in Bolton, which works to upskill 12-22 year olds through a magazine, website and vlog (video blog).

We aim to find out underlying stories about why people have been digitally excluded or chosen not to use computers, and the impact of then being digitally included.    Our “Stories from the Digital Divide” project will work intensively with twelve people with learning disabilities living in Glasgow and the surrounding area. This is a group known to face above average rates of digital exclusion. Within that group we would expect to have people who are older and who are seeking social security allowances. By spending time getting to know them, and working closely with them to develop their basic digital skills (by delivering Quarriers DigiKnow basic IT skills course) over a three month period, the project will be able to produce a piece of grounded action research, rich in qualitative data that seeks to find out more about why people have been digitally excluded and what sort of actions lead to them moving beyond exclusion into participation.    The project will work with twelve individuals to fully document their story around digital exclusion - mapping their story, describing their learning journey on the project and explaining the outcome of their experience. Data on the participants will be collected throughout their time on the project by project staff through semi structured interviews, informal conversations, questionnaires and observations. Data will be collected on an individual participant basis but discussions involving the whole group will also take place to increase the likelihood of peer reflection and support taking place.    Once the twelve participants have been selected they will be split into three groups. Each group will then be tutored once a fortnight for two hours over three months. This number is kept small because this project aim is to focus on each individual and produce an accurate study of their situation and their progress. At the outset a baseline on each participant’s digital skills and experience will be recorded. Any future progress will be measured against this baseline.

We have had various conversations with the Tranent community, (by working in partnership with STRiVE Wellbeing) in East Lothian and people that reside here have reported that they would like to have a Shed that centred on different target audiences. For example, a Community Shed which would encompass a traditional Men’s Shed, but also have capacity for intergenerational activities with younger men and youths too. This is a very different angle and approach to the traditional Men's Shed model that originated in Australia. Furthermore, the Shed would also be open to women in Tranent. This would be only the second Shed in Scotland to open it's doors to women. We believe that this will bring a dynamic where women can learn woodworking skills, be able to carry out different projects and increase their knowledge of different crafts. In turn, the men attending the shed will be able to pass on their knowledge but also learn a variety of different skills from the ladies in attendance. What we want to do: There are three areas that will be developed, and will be user led: 1. A Shed in Tranent will be set up and be based at The Heugh and will focus more on the health and wellbeing of the members; focusing on self-management and reducing social isolation. 2. Purchase a Shed for the members to build (which will give them their first project and allow them to customise it for their future use and projects.) 3. Younger people being involved in the Shed, to promote and build peer education and intergenerational activity.","AmountAwarded":4623,"AwardDate":"2016-12-02","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"GB-SC-SC046141","RecipientOrgName":"Natural Connections","RecipientOrgCharityNumber":"SC046141","RecipientOrgLocation0GeographicCodeType":"WD","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-SC-SC003558","FundingOrgName":"Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations","GrantProgrammeCode":"scvo-ccrf-call-2","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2","Year":2016,"Theme":"Women","ThemeFreq":38,"OrgType":"Charity","OrgTypeFreq":692,"OrgFreq":6,"TotalAmountFounder":40059},{"Identifier":"360G-EFF-13-2877","Title":"Grant to Foresight (North East Lincolnshire) Ltd","Description":"Towards core costs including the salaries of the senior management team, at this community-led, multi-purpose organisation.","AmountAwarded":199294,"AwardDate":"2014-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","URL":"http://www.foresight-nelincs.co.uk.","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1095120","RecipientOrgName":"Foresight (North East Lincolnshire) Ltd","RecipientOrgCharityNumber":"1095120","RecipientOrgCompanyNumber":"04278151","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-200051","FundingOrgName":"Esmée Fairbairn Foundation","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Main Grant","Year":2014,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Charity","OrgTypeFreq":692,"OrgFreq":32,"TotalAmountFounder":3201061},{"Identifier":"360G-CheshireCF-A411092","Title":"Bridgend Buddies","Description":"The Bridgend Centre offers a range of support and activities primarily for older people.

This field destabilises the knowledge base of mental health discourse and practice, where experts have hitherto been seen as the custodians of evidence and knowledge. Positioned as ‘unreason’ since the Enlightenment, it may seem a contradiction that ‘mad’ people could enter the spaces of the academy and generate credible knowledge. To let service users speak in this way promises a novel if troubling project, and one that may prove an antidote to common understandings, professional and lay. The project will trace the histories of mental health user movements internationally as well as those of user-led research, which was grounded in these movements.  The different strands currently making up user-led research will be interrogated as to whether they form a coherent discourse. Interviews and document analysis will be used to understand these questions and the analysis will be guided by adaptations of contemporary theories of resistance and critical theory. Finally, the impacts of user-led research on mental health services provision will be investigated, both what has been achieved and what is envisioned.\n \n ","AmountAwarded":586164,"AwardDate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:Kings-College-London","RecipientOrgName":"King's College London","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Investigator Award in H&SS","Year":2016,"Theme":"Mental Health","ThemeFreq":55,"OrgType":"Univerity or college","OrgTypeFreq":19,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0030105715","Title":"Events 4 Youth","Description":"This new project is a youth led volunteering project that engages, trains and supports young people to identify, plan and run community events for other youth in Hammersmith and Fulham and Hounslow.

Likewise, I have a reputation and passion for delivering innovative, high-quality public engagement across the interface of science, medicine and the humanities.\nPublic engagement has an important role in achieving extraordinary improvements in human health and, as a pioneer who works with the public, including with some of the most deprived, yet creative communities in the UK, I can offer a considerable contribution to the Wellcome Trust Vision. Through my public engagement endeavours, I work responsively to cultural contexts and strive to forge trust in order to breakdown the barriers between researchers and the public. By way of example, my public engagement endeavours have connected non-English speaking communities at risk of disease and infection to work alongside researchers investigating associated biomedical diseases. These public engagement activities have transformed community members into advocates and translators of important health information.\nMy experience and commitment to creativity, intellectual curiosity, professional development and organisational learning ensure I thrive as a Wellcome Trust Fellow. As a filmmaker and archive fanatic I was inspired by the Wellcome Library collection, with a game, Lost Cats Legacy, that caught the attention of Sheffield International Documentary Festival. I am excited by the public engagement possibilities of the digitised material from the Wellcome Library’s collection and the prospect of support from Wellcome staff to unlock its creative potential.\nA Wellcome Fellowship would present considerable strategic added value by helping me to consolidate lessons from ‘networked’ and citizen-led approach to public engagement that I am pursuing. Specifically I will offer an offering ongoing legacy to support the Trust’s Vision through audiences reached, quality of partnerships and heightened profile of biomedical science.","AmountAwarded":194138,"AwardDate":"2012-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:University-of-Manchester","RecipientOrgName":"University of Manchester","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Public Engagement Fellowship","Year":2012,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Univerity or college","OrgTypeFreq":19,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0030137391","Title":"BME Capacity","Description":"This three-year grant will allow the group to address environmental, health and social exclusion issues in black and minority ethnic (BME) communities and use that to build the capacity of the 32 BME-led groups fronting the sub-projects, resulting in improved community relations through community activity and volunteering.","AmountAwarded":155530,"AwardDate":"2004-11-09","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1100406","RecipientOrgName":"London 21 Sustainability Network","RecipientOrgCharityNumber":"1100406","FundingOrgIdentifier":"360G-blf","FundingOrgName":"The Big Lottery Fund","GrantProgrammeCode":"MK1","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Large Projects","Year":2004,"Theme":"Black, Asian and minority ethnic","ThemeFreq":33,"OrgType":"Charity","OrgTypeFreq":692,"OrgFreq":739,"TotalAmountFounder":350391369.54},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0030067199","Title":"Global Schools Partnership","Description":"The school will provide 15 pupils and 2 teachers with the opportunity to visit Trinidad & Tobago and engage in a variety of cultural activities with local young people from Port of Spain.

While positive results have been demonstrated, the current evidence base is limited by the methodological challenge of capturing the complex nature of change pathways. This project seeks to develop a systems thinking approach that will help address this challenge by generating understanding of the function of networks in citizen-led accountability initiatives and how they contribute to health system strengthening. The research will be carried out in two phases, in indigenous communities participating in a well-established citizen-led accountability initiative in rural Guatemala. Social network analysis (SNA) will be employed in the first phase to define transmission of information and other resources and qualities of relationships that connect citizens in networks of collective action, and to examine patterns of interaction between these networks and state authorities. SNA permits visualization of the structure of a network and patterns of connections among actors, as well as identification of key actors that facilitate connectivity. The second phase will employ qualitative interpretation of SNA results to enable deeper insight into what the relational qualities mean in practice, as well understanding of conditions shaping the network's capacity to achieve health system responsiveness. The knowledge generated through this approach will be highly relevant for understanding the function of citizen-led initiatives as networks of collective action, and indicating directions for strengthening alliance-building and communication strategies. Research outputs will contribute to strengthening citizen action for health system accountability in Guatemala, advancement of conceptual understanding of accountability networks, and will provide methodological tools for further study.","AmountAwarded":33126,"AwardDate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:Centre-for-Study-Equity-and-Governance-in-Health-Systems","RecipientOrgName":"Centre for Study Equity and Governance in Health Systems","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Joint Health Systems Research Award","Year":2016,"Theme":"Not classified","ThemeFreq":136,"OrgType":"Not classified","OrgTypeFreq":169,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-tudortrust-78244","Title":"Grant to Read Easy UK","Description":"over two years towards the core costs of a volunteer-led, community-based reading tuition programme for adults with reading difficulties across the UK","AmountAwarded":100000,"AwardDate":"2014-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","URL":"http://www.readeasy.org.uk","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1151288","RecipientOrgName":"Read Easy UK","RecipientOrgCharityNumber":"1151288","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1105580","FundingOrgName":"The Tudor Trust","Year":2014,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Charity","OrgTypeFreq":692,"OrgFreq":63,"TotalAmountFounder":3417100},{"Identifier":"360G-tudortrust-85098","Title":"Grant to Talk for Health","Description":"over three years for the running costs of a peer led talking therapy support programme in Islington","AmountAwarded":90000,"AwardDate":"2017-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","URL":"http://www.talkforhealth.org.uk","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"GB-COH-08822250","RecipientOrgName":"Talk for Health","RecipientOrgCompanyNumber":"08822250","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1105580","FundingOrgName":"The Tudor Trust","Year":2017,"Theme":"Not classified","ThemeFreq":136,"OrgType":"Private company","OrgTypeFreq":68,"OrgFreq":63,"TotalAmountFounder":3417100},{"Identifier":"360G-LondonCatalyst-1230062400000Dxio8AAB","Title":"Mosaic Clubhouse - 1","Description":"Out of hours exercise classes, additional support and peer led activities for those suffering from mental health issues","AmountAwarded":5000,"AwardDate":"2015-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-LondonCatalyst-1230012400000d5wwW","RecipientOrgName":"Mosaic Clubhouse","RecipientOrgCharityNumber":"1071705","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1066739","FundingOrgName":"London Catalyst","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Special Interest","Year":2015,"Theme":"Mental Health","ThemeFreq":55,"OrgType":"Charity","OrgTypeFreq":692,"OrgFreq":4,"TotalAmountFounder":25000},{"Identifier":"360G-LBFEW-104991","Title":"Grant to Fens Pool Voluntary Association","Description":"Volunteer led organisation that will continue support of isolated elderly, local young people and volunteer work and experience.

The focus groups will pay particular attention to the concerns of those students who do not currently volunteer. Using recommendations from disabled students, we will implement new marketing and training processes for the beginning of the 2017-18 academic year, with the 5 projects launching in late October and running until early December. We will recruit 10 students with disabilities for each project; in total, the pilots will reach over 75 beneficiaries.

Despite wide use of participatory CLM the conversation around ethics and the use of these methods is still quite young. Bringing these methods into the context of biomedical research raises further ethical questions. Despite its potential, the use of CLM for social research or engagement raises fundamental ethical questions especially around anonymity and consent and dissemination of the media. Through the workshop we hope to share experiences, develop our theoretical thinking and practical skills relating to these questions. We propose to bring together a group of academics, ethicists and practitioners from Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programmes to discuss the use of participatory community led media with a focus on digital story telling method s with vulnerable groups. The workshop will be held in Siem Riep Cambodia from 12-13th March 2015. It will be chaired by Dr Mary Chambers and Sian Aggett.

The REDC course gives a comprehensive overview of clean, secure and sustainable technology options including solar, hydro and wind. It offers an insight into the management of renewable energy projects, from small scale, through to major projects, as a means to enable sustainable development in developing countries. For more information on the course please click here. \n\nAs we have encountered in the past, there is great interest from individuals and community-led organisations from developing countries to develop their skills in this area however, they are unable to raise the necessary funds to take the course. Therefore we have created a bursary fund to enable participants from marginalised communities and countries to develop key technical knowledge and skills in renewable energy technologies and project management through this innovative training course by offering the course to selected communities leaders for a lower-cost or free. \n","AmountAwarded":6000,"AwardDate":"2016-01-19T12:47:00.000001+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-LloydsRegisterFdn:ORG-CIFAL-Scotland","RecipientOrgName":"CIFAL Scotland","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-1145988","FundingOrgName":"Lloyd's Register Foundation","Year":2016,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Not classified","OrgTypeFreq":169,"OrgFreq":1,"TotalAmountFounder":6000},{"Identifier":"360G-EFF-16-0899","Title":"Grant to Community Led Initiatives CIC","Description":"Towards salary costs to support the delivery of peer and volunteer mentoring services for prolific ex-offenders and people facing chronic social exclusion.","AmountAwarded":90000,"AwardDate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","URL":"http://www.communityled.org.uk","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-EFF-001b000003VM0oY","RecipientOrgName":"Community Led Initiatives CIC","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-200051","FundingOrgName":"Esmée Fairbairn Foundation","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Main Grant","Year":2016,"Theme":"Not classified","ThemeFreq":136,"OrgType":"Community Interest Company","OrgTypeFreq":25,"OrgFreq":32,"TotalAmountFounder":3201061},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0031034579","Title":"Bristol Inter-generational Peace Garden","Description":"The group will use the funding to develop an intergenerational Peace Garden, which will be maintained by young and older people.

One in three women in India have survived physical or sexual violence, making it a major public health burden. Reviews recommend community mobilization to address violence, but trial evidence is limited. Already implemented in other areas, our intervention has been developed over 16 years of programmatic experience and two years of formative research. Guided by a theory of change, we will compare 24 areas receiving support services, community group, and volunteer activities with 24 areas receiving support services only. These community mobilisation activities will be evaluated through a follow-up survey after three years. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of intimate partner violence, and prevalence of domestic violence, in the preceding year. Secondary outcomes will describe disclosure of violence to support services, community attitudes to violence, bystander intervention, gender equality, and prevalence of non-partner sexual violence. Backed by public engagement, advocacy, and open publication, our vision is of a replicable community-led intervention to address the public health burden of violence against women and girls.\n","AmountAwarded":2413112,"AwardDate":"2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:University-College-London","RecipientOrgName":"University College London","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Senior Research Fellowship Clinical Renewal","Year":2017,"Theme":"Women","ThemeFreq":38,"OrgType":"Univerity or college","OrgTypeFreq":19,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0030119882","Title":"Young Peoples Loan Workshop","Description":"Fresh Ideals Community Interest Company will run a peer mentoring project, led by young people who will help young people aged 16 - 24 who are at risk of, or already borrowing from loan sharks and other unethical lenders.

Likewise, I have a reputation and passion for delivering innovative, high-quality public engagement across the interface of science, medicine and the humanities.\nPublic engagement has an important role in achieving extraordinary improvements in human health and, as a pioneer who works with the public, including with some of the most deprived, yet creative communities in the UK, I can offer a considerable contribution to the Wellcome Trust Vision. Through my public engagement endeavours, I work responsively to cultural contexts and strive to forge trust in order to breakdown the barriers between researchers and the public. By way of example, my public engagement endeavours have connected non-English speaking communities at risk of disease and infection to work alongside researchers investigating associated biomedical diseases. These public engagement activities have transformed community members into advocates and translators of important health information.\nMy experience and commitment to creativity, intellectual curiosity, professional development and organisational learning ensure I thrive as a Wellcome Trust Fellow. As a filmmaker and archive fanatic I was inspired by the Wellcome Library collection, with a game, Lost Cats Legacy, that caught the attention of Sheffield International Documentary Festival. I am excited by the public engagement possibilities of the digitised material from the Wellcome Library’s collection and the prospect of support from Wellcome staff to unlock its creative potential.\nA Wellcome Fellowship would present considerable strategic added value by helping me to consolidate lessons from ‘networked’ and citizen-led approach to public engagement that I am pursuing. Specifically I will offer an offering ongoing legacy to support the Trust’s Vision through audiences reached, quality of partnerships and heightened profile of biomedical science.","AmountAwarded":826,"AwardDate":"2015-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"360G-Wellcome-ORG:Squirrel-Nation-Limited","RecipientOrgName":"Squirrel Nation Limited","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-CHC-210183","FundingOrgName":"The Wellcome Trust","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Public Engagement Fellowship","Year":2015,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Private company","OrgTypeFreq":68,"OrgFreq":29,"TotalAmountFounder":9717055},{"Identifier":"360G-blf-0031037000","Title":"A Soapy Business - Empowering women through community led enterprise","Description":"This organisation provides entrepreneurial training and support to women, particularly those affected by additional barriers.

Our manager has now moved to full time employment and we would like to develop the cafe as a space to try new things, meet new people, engage with local issues and connect with welfare support, employabilty support and access to IT. We take a person centred approach and we are special because we have had great success through encouraging 18 people to complete Glasgow University's Activate course, from which we gained 2 new community initiatives (Tenants' Action group and Parent and Toddler Group) and 4 people have gone to further education. 6 other people are currently taking part in Activate and we expect that further support will be needed as they pursue their own personal or community interests. Our project manager is an Activate tutor. Through Activate people begin to find their voice and have the confidence to speak out and challenge unjust decisions, and know how to understand power and approach authority. This increased capacity allows people to seek help sooner and avoid reaching crisis point. Our success means we need more community development support because we have more people wanting to do things for themselves and their community. The cafe development will depend on skillful person-centred support to develop as a volunteer-led community hub.","AmountAwarded":6500,"AwardDate":"2016-12-02","RecipientOrgIdentifier":"SCVO-001b000003OfS0iAAF-call-2","RecipientOrgName":"Ruchazie Parish Church","RecipientOrgLocation0GeographicCodeType":"WD","FundingOrgIdentifier":"GB-SC-SC003558","FundingOrgName":"Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations","GrantProgrammeCode":"scvo-ccrf-call-2","GrantProgrammeTitle":"Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2","Year":2016,"Theme":"Community","ThemeFreq":249,"OrgType":"Not classified","OrgTypeFreq":169,"OrgFreq":6,"TotalAmountFounder":40059},{"Identifier":"360G-LBFEW-102381","Title":"Grant to DaDa - Disability and Deaf Arts","Description":"Young DaDA, an empowerment programme, which enables disabled young people to use the arts to bring  issues to the fore & learn new skills.
